The World Happiness\n            Report is a survey of global happiness. I chose the report\n            from 2015, which ranked 158 countries according to their\n            level of happiness. The report looks back at the state of\n            happiness in the world today and shows how to explain the\n            differences in happiness between individuals and\n            nations.\n            The happiness score and rankings use data from the Gallup\n            World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the survey’s\n            main life assessment questions in the poll. There are also\n            other factors behind the happiness index, like GDP per\n            capita, life expectancy, freedom, Trust of Government\n            Corruption, or generosity.\n            \n            \n            Data Cleaning\n            I changed Region into 6 different\n            continents: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania,\n            and South America.\n            And I turned Freedom into a factor with\n            three categories: low, medium, high based on which third of\n            the distribution it belongs to.\n            \n            \n            Visualizations\n            1.

Lollipop chart comparing Happiness score by\n            different regions\n            \n            From these two graphs we can see that Europe has the\n            highest Happiness Score and Africa has the lowest Happiness\n            Score. But on average, people living in Oceania and North\n            America are happier than people in other regions.\n            3. Scatterplot comparing GDP and\n            Happiness\n            \n            GDP per Capita and Happiness Score have a weak positive\n            relationship, which means that with the GDP getting higher,\n            people are living happier. Africa countries (rea dots) have\n            relatively lower GDP; Oceania and North America countries\n            have relatively higher GDP than other regions.\n            4.

But the density\n            plot for high freedom level is left-skewed, which means that\n            for regions with high freedom level, there are more people\n            with higher happiness score than others.\n            5. ggmuller comparing Generosity and Happiness by\n            different regions\n            \n            I used ggmuller to compare the relationship between\n            Happiness Score and Generosity by different regions.\n            But actually, I didn’t find a significant relationship\n            between Happiness Score and Generosity. We can see that on\n            average Africa and South America do not have a big\n            difference in their generosity score, but their happiness\n            score have big difference: South America has much higher\n            happiness score than Africa.\n            We can also see in the graph that there is a highest peak\n            in grey, which means that Asia has the highest generosity\n            score. However, the happiness scores of Asia are not\n            significantly high or low.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Data Story\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              Content\n              This data set is called\n              World Happiness Report.
